I assume you’re asking for a list of 100 programming problems to help you learn the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. Since generating such a list dynamically would be impractical in this format, I’ll provide a structured approach: a categorized list of 100 problem ideas that focus on STL components like containers, algorithms, iterators, and more. These problems range from beginner to intermediate levels, ensuring you get hands-on experience with STL. You can implement these in C++ using your preferred editor or an online platform like LeetCode, Codeforces, or HackerRank, which often have similar problems.

Here’s the list, broken into categories for clarity:
